Required files 
##########################

plotFilter.html - HTML and javascript code for visualization
Vis_data.json - Reduced data from PCA on X-Ray Scatter images
thumbnails (folder) - Small versions of X-Ray scatter images
d3 (folder) - Current version of d3.js

##########################
Running the tool
##########################
All of the code is contained in the plotFilter.html file, with the proper references to the thumbnails data folders/files and d3. To launch the tool,
simply open up plotFilter.html in any web browser, although note that our testing was only done in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.


##########################
Using the tool
##########################

The user interface has 4 main areas broken up into four quadrants. The upper left quadrant contains 2D scatter plots in principal component (PC)
space. Clicking on individual points in this plot will pull up images in the upper right quadrant, showing the X-ray scatter (XRS) images
associated with that point. The maximum number of images that can appear is 4 - clicking on a 5th point will clear the existing selections.
Double-clicking in the PC graph space will also clear any existing selections.

The lower left quadrant shows stress/strain curves for each sample (12 in total). Selecting points in the PC plot in the upper right quadrant
will highlight the corresponding point (based on strain) on the stress/strain curve in the lower left quadrant.

Finally, the lower right quadrant contains the controls for filtering and showing the data. "Series Selection" will hide/show the PC and stress/strain
plots for the selected sample. You can also select what PC to plot on the X and Y axis for the PC plot in the upper left. The buttons on the far right
will update the plot based on the filter selections, as well as select/deselect all samples for plotting.
